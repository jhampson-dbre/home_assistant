fail2ban
=========

Install and configure fail2ban to block IPs with excessive failed login attempts to Home Assistant Supervised. The fail2ban sensor integration is also added to Home Assistant

This role is based upon this documentation:

[Banning IPs from Home Assistant and SSH](https://kevinfronczak.com/blog/banning-ips-on-homeassistant-and-ssh)
[fail2ban Integration Documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/fail2ban/)

**WARNING:** This role will make changes to Home Assisant's configuration.yaml and restart Home Assistant. As recommended before making any changes to Home Assisant, ensure you have a good snapshot of your current configuration.

Requirements

- In Home Assistant's configuration.yaml, any pre-existing entries under `http` or `logger` headings will cause this role to fail. These settings are not defined in configuration.yaml by default, but if you have added any custom configuration under either of these headings, please remove it before running this role and then merge any custom configuration with the entries added by this role.
